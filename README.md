# Southern-Water-Corp-OLS-Case-Study
Investigating the anomalies of Southern Water Corps pumping operation to determine the reason for pump failure.


For this particular two part case study I used the libraries below to explore pump data to determine reasons for pump failure.

Matplotlib
Seaborn 
Pandas 
statsmodels.api 

The data is split into two files so we're able to perform rolling standard deviation calculations. I was able to validate my predictions using a multivariate regression model. 

In this project I performed the following: 

Created Line Plots and Box Plots
Completed Descriptive Statistics from the .describe() functions
Detected and Removed Outliers from the Dataset
Subset and Filtered DataFrames
Used For Loops to smartly loop through data
Used Dual Axes to Plot Multiple Variables on different axes
Interpreted Correlation Coefficients and Heatmaps
Created and assessed the goodness of fit for Linear Regression Models
